#### 7. Advanced Topics

- **Decorators:**  Add functionality to existing functions without directly modifying their code, creating reusable decorators.
- **Generators:**  Create efficient iterators that generate values on demand, saving memory and improving performance.
- **Context managers:**  Use `with` statements to automatically manage resources like files or database connections, ensuring proper cleanup.
- **Regular expressions (regex):**  Pattern matching and manipulation of text data using powerful regular expressions.

#### 8. Web Development

- **Introduction to web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django):**  Understand the basics of web frameworks, which provide a structure for building web applications.

#### 9. Databases

- **Introduction to databases:**  Gain a basic understanding of database concepts, including relational databases, SQL, and database schemas.
- **Using SQLite with Python:**  Work with SQLite, a lightweight database embedded in Python, for storing and retrieving data.
- **SQLAlchemy (ORM):**  Explore Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy to simplify database interactions, mapping objects to database tables.

#### 10. Testing and Debugging

- **Unit testing with unittest or pytest:**  Write unit tests to ensure that individual functions and modules work correctly, improving code reliability.
- **Debugging techniques:**  Learn effective debugging techniques like using print statements, the debugger, and code inspection to identify and fix errors.

#### 11. Data Science and Machine Learning (Optional)

- **Data analysis with Pandas:**  Manipulate, clean, and analyze data using the powerful Pandas library, a core tool for data scientists.
- **Data visualization with Matplotlib or Seaborn:**  Create informative and visually appealing data visualizations to gain insights from your data.

#### 12. Web Scraping (Optional)

- **Beautiful Soup and requests library:**  Use the requests library to download web pages and Beautiful Soup to parse HTML and extract data, enabling web scraping.
- **Scraping data from websites:**  Extract useful information from websites, such as product prices, news articles, or social media posts, using web scraping techniques.

#### 13. Deployment and Hosting

- **Deploying web applications (e.g., Heroku, AWS):**  Learn to deploy your web applications to hosting platforms like Heroku or AWS, making them accessible to the world.
- **Hosting Python scripts:**  Deploy your Python scripts or programs to be executed on a server, enabling them to run continuously.

#### 14. Version Control (Optional)
